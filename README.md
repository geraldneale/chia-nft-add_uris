# chia-nft-add_uris
Automated system of aggregating all NFTs in a "wallet" and updating the URIs in bulk.

This works for me on my collection that I created using an NFT naming scheme that fits the program. You will have to modify. Open sourcing it because I don't think there are other examples online how to do this.
